Description of Game Mechanics:

The Hero (named as "Phoenix") is in alpha world. The objective of the game is to revive 1000 legends from the alpha world. But  there are some devil floating in this world. Each time you go within their range they will start to shoot you which will slow you down. If you bumped into one of the devil it will freeze you for few seconds causing damage also. Talking of damage, yes you have a health of 100 at the start of the game but you won't die if it becomes 0 because Hero Never Dies. Rather you will be regenerate into two instance of you (like hydra). While the main player will be the playable character, the other one (that has been generated), will try to cause you damage. But you can not kill them either because they are YOU meaning they are immortal too. So what can you do? Since they follow you, you can make them follow you to a distance from a spawned legend so that you can revive them. You can also use the bushes as cover. Because whenever you are in the bush, the regenerated YOU and the devil won't follow you. Now each time you want to revive a legend, you will need 30 "blessings" (this can be earned from a temple in the world and initially you will have 120 blessings.). Also each time you kill a devil, it will cost you 10 "blessings". Spending too much "blessings" will cause in negative blessing. So make sure to have enough "blessings" all the time by collecting blessings from nearest temple but each time you get blessings from a temple, a timer will be set and after each 50s your blessings will decrease by 30 . After reviving one legend, another legend will be spawned in the world. How will you find them? Well there's a text at the bottom of the screen showing which direction to go and what is the distance. The format is "A10.2" which indicates "Above 10.2m". Similarly B indicates Below, L meaning Left and R meaning Right.  (Another way to find spawned legend is clock ticking sound which is a spatial sound but it doesn't work always [BUG:3])The game will be over if there is 12 of you in the alpha world so try not regenerate yourself too much by getting too much damage. Try to revive as much legend as possible!  You will have 40s for each legend to revive.

Game Story:

Phoenix's (The Hero of the Game) family was killed by Zephyrus, the god of Chaos. When Phoenix grew up, he wanted to take revenge on Zephyrus. But Zephyrus can only be killed with the power of 1000 legends. Phoenix's father gave him a box when he died. That box had a magic spell. Whenever Phoenix opened the box, the god of Immortal, Hydra was awakened. Phoenix expressed his desire of taking revenge on Zephyrus. Hydra granted him his wish and made him the Hero of the Alpha World. Alpha World is a place where all the legends are undead meaning they are not alive but not dead either. They can be revived by a Hero only. In this alpha world, the Hero never dies. But hero can be damaged and with too much damage, hero will be regenerated into another instance of himself but evil. Help Phoenix on his journey to revive the thousand legends. 

Important Notes:

There's a bug if you return to the main Menu and then again play. The game functionality doesn't work properly. So if you want to play again then exit the game and play again by starting the Phoenix.exe again. 

While in game, press ESC to come back to the main menu. But after coming to main menu don't start, because the game doesn't function properly. 

Developer Notes: 

There could be more bugs. I tried to fix the game reset functionality but since every code for each mechanics was written from scratch and single-handedly and due to time limitation, I couldn't fix that. I hope the judge will consider.
